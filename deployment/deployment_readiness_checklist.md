# Deployment Readiness Assessment

Before deploying updates to the production environment, it's essential to evaluate the deployment's readiness systematically. The following checklist serves as a guide to ensure all critical aspects are reviewed and validated:

## Deployment Readiness Checklist

1. **Code Review**
   - Ensure all code changes have undergone peer review.
   - Confirm adherence to coding standards and best practices.

2. **Automated Testing**
   - Verify that unit tests cover all new and modified code paths.
   - Ensure that integration tests validate interactions between components.
   - Ensure that [AWS CDK tests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/testing.html) validate that particular resources and their properties are defined as intended.
   - The CI/CD pipeline is configured to proceed to subsequent stages only if all tests pass successfully.

3. **Security Assessment**
   - Ensure compliance with organizational security policies and standards.
   - Automate running the 'npm audit' command in the CI/CD pipeline to cross-references your dependencies against the Node Security advisories.
   - For deep security integrate your application with a security platform tool. One example of such tool is [Snyk](https://snyk.io/), and it can be used for:
     - Analyzing your codebase to detect security issues early in the development lifecycle.
     - Examining container images for vulnerabilities.
     - Identifying IaC misconfigurations that could lead to security breaches.
     - Creating dashboards and reports for application security overview.
     - Generating detailed security reports, providing insights into vulnerabilities, their severity, and recommended remediation steps.

4. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Validation**
   - Confirm that infrastructure changes are defined using AWS CDK.
   - Use [cdk-nag](https://github.com/cdklabs/cdk-nag) to validate the correctness of CDK constructs and configurations. 
     - To integrate the AWS Solutions and HIPAA security NagPacks into an AWS CDK v2 TypeScript application on an applicationwide level, you can use the following code:

   ```typescript
       import { App, Aspects } from 'aws-cdk-lib';
       import { CdkTestStack } from '../lib/cdk-test-stack';
       import { AwsSolutionsChecks, HIPAASecurityChecks } from 'cdk-nag';
        
       const app = new App();
       new CdkTestStack(app, 'CdkNagDemo');
       // Simple rule informational messages
       Aspects.of(app).add(new AwsSolutionsChecks());
       // Additional explanations on the purpose of triggered rules
       Aspects.of(app).add(new HIPAASecurityChecks({ verbose: true }));
   ```

5. **Rollback Strategy**
   - Ensure backups or previous versions are available for restoration.
   - Develop detailed runbooks that include step-by-step instructions for triggering and executing a rollback in case of failure. This should cover:
     - Pre-requisites (e.g., snapshots, backups, current deployment version).
     - Commands, scripts, or procedures to reverse the deployment.
     - Verification steps to confirm the rollbackâ€™s success.
    - Include guidelines for a post-mortem analysis following a rollback. Document what metrics or logs should be reviewed and how lessons learned will be incorporated into future deployment and rollback strategies.
    - Make use of AWS mechanisms for implementing a rollback strategy:
      - [For AWS Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuring-alias-routing.html)
        - When using CodeDeploy with Lambda, you can define deployment configurations that include a canary step (e.g., 10% of traffic for a set duration). If CloudWatch alarms or other monitoring indicate a failure during this phase, CodeDeploy can automatically revert the changes.
      - [For API Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/canary-release.html)
        - API Gateway supports canary releases by allowing you to split traffic between stages. You can gradually route a portion of the traffic to the new deployment, and if issues arise, quickly revert to the previous stage configuration.
      - [Pipeline Integration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/stage-rollback.html)
        - With pipeline v2, the entire process from deployment to monitoring is integrated. This means that if a canary release doesn't meet the defined criteria for success, the pipeline can automatically execute a rollback, ensuring your production environment remains stable.
6. **Team Communication Flow**
   - **Pre-Deployment**
     - **Preparation for deployment:**
       - Team reviews the **Deployment Readiness Checklist**: Discuss changes, deployment plans, timelines, risks, and compliance requirements.
       - Clarify any technical or business concerns.
 
     - **Roles & Responsibilities:**
       - **Developers:** Present technical changes and highlight known issues.
       - **Tech Lead:** Oversee the deployment plan and ensure critical steps are defined.
       - **QA:** Confirm testing is complete and that there are no regressions.
       - **BA:** Ensure that changes align with business requirements.
       - **Product Owner:** Communicate business priorities and potential customer impact.
       - **Stakeholders:** Provide feedback and confirm alignment with business goals.
     - **Follow-Up:**  
       - A summary email is sent to all participants, outlining the discussion, confirmed deployment timeline, and action items.
   - **During Deployment**
     - **Real-Time Communication:**  
     A dedicated channel (e.g., Slack or Teams) is used for live updates.
     - **Roles & Responsibilities:**
       - **Developers:** Execute the deployment and provide continuous status updates.
       - **Tech Lead:** Monitor the process and make real-time decisions if issues arise.
       - **QA:** Conduct any necessary post-deployment testing.
       - **Product Owner & Stakeholders:** Stay informed on progress and potential delays.
   - **Post-Deployment**
     - **Summary Communication:**  
     A concise email is sent to all stakeholders summarizing the deployment outcome and any issues encountered.

     - **Roles & Responsibilities:**
       - **Developers:** Document deployment details and note any issues for follow-up.
       - **Tech Lead:** Provide a final review and propose improvements for future releases.
       - **QA:** Verify deployment stability and alignment with test outcomes.
       - **Product Owner & BA:** Confirm that the release meets customer expectations and business objectives.

7. **Documentation**
   - Update system and user documentation to reflect changes.
