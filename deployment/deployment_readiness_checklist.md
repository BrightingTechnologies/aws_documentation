# Deployment Readiness Assessment

Before deploying updates to the production environment, it's essential to evaluate the deployment's readiness systematically. The following checklist serves as a guide to ensure all critical aspects are reviewed and validated:

## Deployment Readiness Checklist

1. **Code Review**

   - Ensure all code changes have undergone peer reviews.

2. **Deployment plan**

   - Confirm that the deployment plan has been provided for the current release

3. **Automated Testing and Manual testing**

   - Verify that CI tests have passed for the current release in the pre-prod environment
   - Verify that the manual tests have been executed

4. **Security Assessment**

   - Verify that code has passed security auditing by the automated tools during the CI/CD

5. **Configuration items**

   - Verify that all the secrets, parameterers or other configuration items have been added to the AWS Account according to the deployment plan

6. **Rollback Strategy**

   - Establish a comprehensive rollback plan, specifying the conditions that trigger a rollback and the procedures to execute it effectively.

7. **Team Communication Flow**

   - **Pre-Deployment**

     - **Preparation for deployment:**

       - Team reviews the **Deployment Readiness Checklist**: Discuss changes, deployment plans, timelines, risks, and compliance requirements.
       - Clarify any technical or business concerns.

     - **Roles & Responsibilities:**
       - **Developers:** Present technical changes and highlight known issues.

       A dedicated channel (e.g., Slack or Teams) is used for live updates.
     - **Roles & Responsibilities:**
       - **Developers:** Execute the deployment and provide continuous status updates.
       - **Tech Lead:** Monitor the process and make real-time decisions if issues arise.
       - **QA:** Conduct any necessary post-deployment testing.
       - **Product Owner & Stakeholders:** Stay informed on progress and potential delays.
   - **Post-Deployment**

       A concise email is sent to all stakeholders summarizing the deployment outcome and any issues encountered.

     - **Roles & Responsibilities:**
       - **Developers:** Document deployment details and note any issues for follow-up.
       - **Tech Lead:** Provide a final review and propose improvements for future releases.
       - **QA:** Verify deployment stability and alignment with test outcomes.
